# An Example of PKCS#7 Padding Attack

This is a project that I made during my studies. It performs a padding attack
on PKCS#7. A ciphertext is encrypted using CBC (IV is 16B). This project was a
part of a larger project that is unfortunately not available under open source
license. Obtained 10/10 points.

Use on your own risk!
